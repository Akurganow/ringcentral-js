     to change its pricing policies for the RingCentral API at any time in its sole discretion. RingCentral shall
     provide Licensee reasonable prior written notice of such changes.

4. RingCentral’s Rights of Control Over the RingCentral API
-----------------------------------------------------------

4.1. RingCentral may limit or suspend Licensee’s usage of or access to the RingCentral API if, in RingCentral’s
     reasonable discretion, Licensee or Licensee’s RingCentral Applications are adversely affecting the performance

     of any such actions as soon as reasonably practical.

4.2. API Modifications

       at any time (an “API Modification”). RingCentral shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide prior
       notice to Licensee of any such actions as soon as reasonably practical. Licensee shall, within thirty (30) days

5. RingCentral’s Review of RingCentral Applications
---------------------------------------------------

5.1. In its sole discretion at any time, RingCentral may perform, at its sole cost, a security review of any of
     Licensee’s RingCentral Applications to ensure that the RingCentral Application complies with this Agreement, 
     the EULA, or any other agreement between RingCentral and Licensee and that the RingCentral Application does not
     threaten the security, integrity, or performance of the Services or any RingCentral Components (a “Security
     Review”). RingCentral shall provide Licensee reasonable prior written notice of any Security Review. Licensee shall
     provide RingCentral, at no charge, full user-level access to the RingCentral Application and shall reasonably
     cooperate with RingCentral in the Security Review. RingCentral may perform the Security Review itself or through
     third parties on RingCentral’s behalf (and such third parties shall treat all information obtained through the
     Security Review as Confidential Information under this Agreement).

5.2. A Security Review may include, without limitation, any or all of the following steps:

5.2.1. The Licensee’s completion of a questionnaire;

5.2.2. Meetings or discussions at a reasonable time and place with Licensee’s developers;

5.2.3. Technical security testing by RingCentral of the RingCentral Application; and

5.2.4. To the extent the RingCentral Application uses Components other than RingCentral Components, RingCentral may
       perform penetration testing, remote application-level security testing, network-level security testing, and
       vulnerability threat assessments on such Components.

5.3. In performing the Security Review, RingCentral shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure its review
     does not cause any material adverse effect on any of Licensee’s Components supporting the RingCentral Application.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, RingCentral shall not be liable for any adverse effects on such Components
     that could not have been avoided or foreseen through commercially reasonable efforts.

5.4. RingCentral shall inform Licensee of any issues discovered during the Security Review in writing and in reasonable
     detail. RingCentral may immediately revoke the license afforded Licensee pursuant to this Agreement if it discovers
     any such issues, and Licensee shall promptly cease distribution, support, and operation of the applicable
     RingCentral Application.

5.5. A Security Review by RingCentral shall not be deemed a warranty or certification of the applicable
     RingCentral Application, nor shall it limit Licensee’s liability for the breach of, or waive Licensee’s compliance
     with, any provision of this Agreement.

5.6. Licensee shall treat the occurrence of, results of, and any communications in connection with a Security Review
     as Confidential Information. For the avoidance of doubt, Licensee shall not use such information in any marketing
     or advertising of its RingCentral Applications.

6. Licensee’s Responsibilities
------------------------------

6.1. Licensee may not access or use the RingCentral API for any purposes if it is a direct competitor of RingCentral.

6.2. End Users shall be Subscribers to Services. Licensee must use best efforts to ensure that RingCentral Applications
     do not permit End Users who are not Subscribers to access or use the Services. In the event Licensee discovers that
     an End User is not a Subscriber, Licensee shall use best efforts to prevent that End User from using the
     RingCentral Application.

6.3. With respect to the RingCentral Applications, Licensee acknowledges and agrees that RingCentral has no obligations,
     responsibilities, or liabilities to End Users.

6.4. Licensee must comply with the restrictions set forth in this Agreement and the EULA in all uses of the
     RingCentral API, Account Data, and the Services. Licensee must also comply with the restrictions set forth in
     this Agreement and the RingCentral’s then-current trademark and branding guidelines in all uses of the RingCentral
     Marks.

6.5. In order to use and access the RingCentral API, Licensee must obtain API credentials (a “Token”) by becoming
     a Subscriber. Licensee may not share its Token, shall keep such Token and all login information secure, and shall
     use it as Licensee’s sole means of accessing the RingCentral API.

6.6. Licensee’s RingCentral Applications shall not substantially replicate products or services offered by RingCentral,
     including, without limitation, functions or clients on platforms (such as iOS or Android) where RingCentral offers
     its own client or a substantially similar function. By way of example only, Licensee may not develop a RingCentral
     Application for use on an iPhone that permits an End User to make general phone calls to the public switched
     telephone network because doing so would substantially replicate RingCentral’s mobile application for the iPhone.
     Licensee agrees that RingCentral may develop and publish applications that are similar to or otherwise compete
     with Licensee’s applications.

6.7. RingCentral Applications may not use or access the RingCentral API or the Services in order to monitor the
     availability, performance, or functionality of the RingCentral API or Services or for any similar benchmarking or
     competitive purposes.

6.8. RingCentral Applications shall not, in any manner, display any form of advertising that uses Account Data.

6.9. Licensee shall not, under any circumstances, through a RingCentral Application or otherwise, repackage or resell
     the Services, RingCentral API, or Account Data.

6.10. Licensee is not permitted to use the RingCentral API, Services, or Account Data in any manner that does or could
      potentially undermine the security or performance of the Service, the RingCentral API, Account Data, or
      the Services. In addition, Licensee shall not, and shall not attempt to, interfere with, modify or disable any
      features, functionality or security controls of the Services or the RingCentral API; defeat, avoid, bypass,
      remove, deactivate or otherwise circumvent any protection mechanisms for the Services or the RingCentral API;
      or reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or derive source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, structure,
      or organizational form from the Services or the RingCentral API.

6.11. Licensee acknowledges and agrees that Licensee is solely responsible, and that RingCentral has no responsibility
      or liability of any kind, for (a) the content, development, operation, sale, support, or maintenance of
      RingCentral Applications; or (b) Licensee’s inability to continue providing RingCentral Applications (in whole
      or part) due to the termination or expiration of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, Licensee will
      be solely responsible for (i) the installation, operation, maintenance, and support of its RingCentral
      Applications; (ii) creating and displaying information and content on, through or within its RingCentral
      Applications; (iii) ensuring that its RingCentral Applications do not violate or infringe the Intellectual
      Property Rights of any third party; (iv) ensuring that RingCentral Applications are not offensive, profane,
      obscene, libelous or otherwise illegal; (v) ensuring that its RingCentral Applications do not contain or
      introduce Malicious Software into the Services, the RingCentral API, any Account Data or other data stored
      or transmitted using the Service, or Subscriber Components; (vi) ensuring that its RingCentral Applications
      are not designed to or utilized for the purpose of sending Spam to any RingCentral Subscribers or others; and
      (vii) transitioning End Users off a RingCentral Application when that RingCentral application is no longer
      available for any reason.

6.12. Licensee will respect and comply with the technical and policy-implemented limitations of the RingCentral API
      and the restrictions of this Agreement in designing and implementing RingCentral Applications.

6.13. Prior to accessing any Subscriber’s account or Account Data or otherwise utilizing a Subscriber’s Services,
      Licensee shall disclose in writing and reasonable detail to the Subscriber (a) that the RingCentral Application
      will have Account Access; (b) the nature of the Account Access, including without limitation how the Service
      will be used and what Account Data will be accessed or modified by the RingCentral Application; and (c) where,
      if applicable, Account Data may be stored, transmitted, or accessed outside of RingCentral Components. 
      The Subscriber must provide express consent prior to any Account Access, and such consent shall be limited to
      the scope of what is disclosed in the previous sentence (the “Subscriber’s Access Consent”). Licensee shall
      promptly cease any Account Access upon the Subscriber’s withdrawal of the Subscriber’s Access Consent.

6.14. In no event shall Licensee or the RingCentral Application engage in Account Access or transmit, store, or access
      Account Data outside the scope of the Subscriber’s Access Consent.

6.15. Sections 6.13 to 6.14 shall not apply to the extent (and only to the extent) that Licensee uses a RingCentral
      Application solely with its own subscription to the Services. Licensee’s consent to such Account Access shall
      be deemed given in such cases.

12. Disclaimer of Warranties
----------------------------

12.1. THE RINGCENTRAL API SERVICES ARE INTENDED FOR GENERAL BUSINESS USE ONLY. THEY ARE NOT DESIGNED, MANUFACTURED,
      INTENDED, OR RECOMMENDED FOR USE OR RESALE AS EQUIPMENT OR SERVICES IN ENVIRONMENTS REQUIRING FAIL-SAFE
      PERFORMANCE (E.G., EMERGENCY MEDICAL CARE, HAZARDOUS ACTIVITIES) OR IN WHICH THE FAILURE OF THE SERVICES COULD
      LEAD TO DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, OR SEVERE PHYSICAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE. RINGCENTRAL SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS

      WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. RINGCENTRAL EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS
      OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR 
      A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. LICENSEE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT RINGCENTRAL DOES NOT WARRANT THAT 
      THE SERVICE OR RINGCENTRAL API WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, ERROR-FREE, OR FREE FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER 
      MALICIOUS SOFTWARE, OR THAT ANY DEFECT IN THE RINGCENTRAL API WILL BE CORRECTED. IN ADDITION, RINGCENTRAL MAKES 
      NO WARRANTIES THAT THE RINGCENTRAL API SHALL NOT CAUSE DISRUPTIONS, ERRORS, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF USE, OR OTHER

13. Limitation of Liability
---------------------------

13.1. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, OR OTHERWISE) WILL 
      RINGCENTRAL, ITS AFFILIATES, OR THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUBCONTRACTORS, 
      RESELLERS, OR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE, ITS END USERS, OR ANY OTHER THIRD PARTIES FOR ANY INDIRECT, 
      INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOST SALES 
      OR BUSINESS, LOST DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR ANY OTHER LOSS INCURRED BY LICENSEE, ITS END USERS, OR ANY

      ONE (1) YEAR OF THE EVENTS GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.

13.3. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental 
      or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply to Licensee. IN THESE 
      JURISDICTIONS, RINGCENTRAL’S LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. The limitations 
      set forth in this Section 13 will survive termination or expiration of this Agreement and apply even if

      by Licensee or those acting on its behalf, (ii) any violation of law or regulation by Licensee or the RingCentral 
      Application, (iii) Licensee’s gross negligence, recklessness, or willful misconduct, and (iv) any use
